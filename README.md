# Image-Processing-Line-Detection-Fitting
This MATLAB project demonstrates various image processing techniques, focusing on:

Edge detection (Canny, Harris)
Line detection and fitting
RANSAC algorithm for robust model fitting
The scripts are designed to process images of buildings and hinges to detect and fit lines accurately.
